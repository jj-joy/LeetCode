Find-the-Difference

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.


func findTheDifference(s string, t string) byte {
    var e byte = 0
    for _, i := range s {
    	e = e ^ byte(i)
    }
    for _, j := range t {
    	e = e ^ byte(j)
    }
    return e
}
