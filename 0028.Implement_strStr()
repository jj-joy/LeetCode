0028.Implement_strStr()

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
    Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
    Output: 2

Example 2:
    Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
    Output: -1

Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().


func strStr(haystack string, needle string) int {
    hlen, nlen := len(haystack), len(needle)
    for i := 0; i < hlen - nlen; i++ {
        if haystack[i:i+nlen] == needle {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}
