0374.Guess_Number_Higher_or_Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
    -1 : My number is lower
     1 : My number is higher
     0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example :
    Input: n = 10, pick = 6
    Output: 6


/**
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			      1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * func guess(num int) int;
 */

func guessNumber(n int) int {
    for low, high := 1, n; low <= high; {
        mid := (low + high) / 2
        res := guess(mid)
        if res < 0 {
            high = mid - 1
        } else if res > 0 {
            low = mid + 1
        } else {
            return mid
        }
    }
    return 0
}
